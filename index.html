        <!--Personal Summary-->
        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p>Currently undergoing a transition in career, utilising the important fundamentals of Python, Sql & analytical
            problem solving skills that have been harnessed as a self directed learner,<br> Recently reinforced by the skills
            acquired during the part time Software Engineering bootcamp that Is underway at the moment. From creating
            small scale projects from the ground up,<br> to getting comfortable with databases and algorithms and designing a
            system which interacts with a database, helping to build confidence and a strong fundamental knowledge that will<br>
            continue to grow over time with an excited passion for figuring out how and why things work. Former experience
            as a wood technician and in other roles has also given me confidence<br> in my ability to be a productive and helpful
            team member who can communicate effectively and offer help or advice to those who need it, or asking when it is
            required.<br><br>I am motivated by the freedom that having developer skills brings including having the opportunity of
            working from home and anywhere in the world. I enjoy the great feelings of reward <br> and accomplishment when I encounter
            and overcome problems in my projects. In the future I would like to work as a junior at a company for a few years before
            progressing<br> to a mid level dev, at the same time. Researching intensively in my own time at home and developing full stack
            skills before finally,<br> branching out into a full stack career path where I have great levels of freedom and work life balance. </p>

        <h3>My Projects</h3>
        <p> During my time studying for the HyperionDev Software Engineering bootcamp I have been challenged numerous times, most of all on the Capstone project tasks.<br>
            These projects test our abilities on everything that we have learned in the day to day lessons that we are working on. The very first project that I made was
            a finance calculator,<br> working out the compound interest growth rates for people's finances and there was another option to work out monthly bond repayments as well.<br>
            I remember feeling hugely accomplished when I pressed run for the final time and everything worked accordingly. <br>It felt like a big achievement to see all of these lines
            of text, being able to understand it all, and most importantly the fact that you've wrote this from scratch.<br> It really cemented in my mind that this is what I want to as a career.<br><br>

            <h4>My Favourite Project</h4><br>
            One project which I remember really enjoying working on was the Task_manager.py program, utilising functions and lists, there were several times I really struggled,<br>
            when my code wasn't working as intended, it taught me to persevere and be resilient when facing problems and questioning whether I was good enough to do this or not. <br>
            I really felt a sense of progression with this Capstone task as it began as a single line of code and ended up being over 400 lines in the end.<br>I am happy with the finished product,
            although in the future I am going to return to this one to add more functionality and incorporate it into a GUI - (Graphical User interface)<br><br>

        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>I attended Priory Science High College and took part in extracurricular activities like Tennis and Basketball, I was also in a rock band as the lead guitarist
            as I had taught myself how to play on youtube.<br> We did a few events for the school and for the parents as well which was really fun. I achieved 9 Gcses all graded B-C.
            After High school i enrolled onto a Business level 3 Btech at Runshaw College in Leyland<br>and enjoyed the course. However unfortunately I never completed college due to
            family issues affecting me at the time as my step dad couldn't work and was struggling with Lymphoma cancer.<br>I regret not completing my business course, this is the reason
            that I am so disciplined today. It motivates me to give everything my 110% effort and to never give up!</p>
